Strapi’s fantastic for giving them an interface to organize content to be consumed by frontends, but many of their needs work directly against Git-centric development workflows (aka GitOps) we see today.\n \nIn this talk, we’ll cover how Strapi can be deployed alongside a frontend consuming application on a single project on Platform.sh. From there, we’ll slowly piece together two parallel workflows for teams with very different needs in mind:\n- Editorial: don’t touch Git. Live content previews. Runtime collection creation that moves to master. \n- Development: Git as the source of truth, repeatable builds, isolated environments, Infrastructure-as-code. ",

Have you ever run into an editorial team who just doesn’t want to get their hands dirty with Git? There’s plenty of them. Strapi’s fantastic for giving them an interface to organize content to be consumed by frontends, but many of their needs work directly against Git-centric development workflows (aka GitOps) we see today.\n \nIn this talk, we’ll cover how Strapi can be deployed alongside a frontend consuming application on a single project on Platform.sh. From there, we’ll slowly piece together two parallel workflows for teams with very different needs in mind:\n- Editorial: don’t touch Git. Live content previews. Runtime collection creation that moves to master. \n- Development: Git as the source of truth, repeatable builds, isolated environments, Infrastructure-as-code. ",

      "description": "Headless Commerce APIs give you the same flexibility and scalability as you can expect from a Headless CMS. Where e-commerce platforms are designed to work with product data and checkout systems, the latter is best suited to manage rich web content for the rest of your website. To keep this separation of concern, you combine these two headless architectures! In this talk I'll show how to use the headless Saleor Commerce and enrich that data by combining it with Strapi CMS. \n",

      "description": "There’s a general misconception that since Jamstack sites and applications don't rely on traditional server architectures, they come at the cost of dynamic, powerful experiences. The reality is, Jamstack sites are great for creating highly dynamic, interactions using powerful tools like serverless functions and a variety of third-party services.\n\nIn this session, we'll look at how a Jamstack architecture, with serverless functions and Strapi CMS, help developers deliver scale, performance, and a rich content authoring experience, without the burden of servers or infrastructure to maintain\"",

      "description": "How do we reconcile the differences between the needs of our developers and those of our content creation teams? Have you ever run into an editorial team who just doesn’t want to get their hands dirty with Git? There’s plenty of them. Strapi’s fantastic for giving them an interface to organize content to be consumed by frontends, but many of their needs work directly against Git-centric development workflows (aka GitOps) we see today.\n \nIn this talk, we’ll cover how Strapi can be deployed alongside a frontend consuming application on a single project on Platform.sh. From there, we’ll slowly piece together two parallel workflows for teams with very different needs in mind:\n- Editorial: don’t touch Git. Live content previews. Runtime collection creation that moves to master. \n- Development: Git as the source of truth, repeatable builds, isolated environments, Infrastructure-as-code. ",
